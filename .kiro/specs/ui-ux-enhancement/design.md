- Accent: Cyan (#06B6D4) and Pink (#EC4899) - for highlights and CTAs
- Neutral: Enhanced gray scale with proper contrast ratios
- Dark theme: Deep space blues and purples with high contrast text

**Typography System:**
- Headings: Orbitron (existing) for tech aesthetic, with fallback to system fonts

### Component Architecture

**Atomic Design Approach:**
- Atoms: Buttons, inputs, icons, typography
