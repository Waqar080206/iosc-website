# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on updating the existing hero section and Spline components with Intel's current branding colors and visual identity. The implementation will specifically target the heroSection.jsx and Spline-related components to incorporate Intel's blue gradient color scheme and modern visual elements while maintaining existing functionality and animations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the IoSC-EDC website, I want the hero section to reflect Intel's current branding colors, so that the visual identity aligns with Intel's modern aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the hero section background SHALL use Intel's signature blue gradient color scheme
2. WHEN a user views the hero section THEN the color palette SHALL match Intel's current brand guidelines (deep blue to lighter blue gradient)
3. WHEN a user sees text elements in the hero THEN they SHALL have appropriate contrast against the Intel-branded background
4. WHEN a user views the hero on different devices THEN the Intel color branding SHALL remain consistent and properly rendered
5. IF a user has accessibility needs THEN the Intel color scheme SHALL maintain WCAG contrast requirements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the Spline 3D elements, I want them to complement the Intel branding colors, so that the visual experience is cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views Spline 3D components THEN they SHALL incorporate Intel's blue color palette in their materials or lighting
2. WHEN a user interacts with Spline elements THEN any color transitions SHALL use Intel-branded colors
3. WHEN a user sees the Spline scene THEN the background or environment SHALL complement the Intel blue gradient theme
4. WHEN a user views animated Spline elements THEN color animations SHALL enhance the Intel branding experience
5. IF a user has reduced motion preferences THEN Spline color effects SHALL respect accessibility settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the code, I want Intel color values to be properly defined and reusable, so that the branding can be consistently applied and easily updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Intel colors are implemented THEN they SHALL be defined as CSS custom properties or design tokens
2. WHEN components use Intel colors THEN they SHALL reference centralized color variables
3. WHEN the hero section is styled THEN Intel gradient definitions SHALL be reusable across components
4. WHEN Spline components need Intel colors THEN they SHALL access the same color system
5. IF Intel branding colors need updates THEN changes SHALL be made in a single location

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing the website, I want smooth transitions when Intel branding colors are applied, so that the visual changes feel polished and intentional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hero section loads THEN Intel color gradients SHALL render smoothly without visual artifacts
2. WHEN Spline components initialize THEN Intel-branded colors SHALL load seamlessly with the 3D scene
3. WHEN users interact with branded elements THEN color transitions SHALL be smooth and performant
4. WHEN the page renders THEN Intel color gradients SHALL not cause layout shifts or performance issues
5. IF animations are present THEN they SHALL enhance the Intel branding without causing visual conflicts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want Intel branding colors to display correctly on my device, so that the visual experience is consistent across all screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the hero section on mobile THEN Intel gradients SHALL render properly on smaller screens
2. WHEN a user interacts with Spline elements on mobile THEN Intel colors SHALL maintain their visual impact
3. WHEN a user rotates their mobile device THEN Intel branding colors SHALL adapt to orientation changes
4. WHEN a user has a lower-end mobile device THEN Intel color gradients SHALL not impact performance
5. IF a user has limited bandwidth THEN Intel color implementations SHALL not increase loading times significantly
